There are a gazillion different ways to map precinct-level results. Here are four of them I considered for this November 15, 2018 story on Anne Arundel's County Executive race in The Capital: ["Pittman rode early voting to victory, flipped precincts Schuh won easily in 2014"](https://www.capitalgazette.com/news/elections/ac-cn-executive-precincts-1115-story.html).

The story uses the first map ("Heat map, no density adjustment"). Which map do *you* like best? Check out the mapping [code](https://github.com/underthecurve/four-ways-precinct-maps/blob/master/four_ways.ipynb) for more info. 

Plus if you want even MORE info and data about the precinct results / shapefiles, check out the Baltimore Sun Data/Interactives team's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/baltimore-sun-data/maryland-2018-governor-precinct-map).
